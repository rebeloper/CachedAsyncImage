/// Loads, displays and caches a modifiable image from the specified URL in phases.

/// If you set the asynchronous image's URL to `nil`, or after you set the
/// URL to a value but before the load operation completes, the phase is
/// ``AsyncImagePhase/empty``. After the operation completes, the phase
/// becomes either ``AsyncImagePhase/failure(_:)`` or
/// ``AsyncImagePhase/success(_:)``. In the first case, the phase's
/// ``AsyncImagePhase/error`` value indicates the reason for failure.
/// In the second case, the phase's ``AsyncImagePhase/image`` property
/// contains the loaded image. Use the phase to drive the output of the
/// `content` closure, which defines the view's appearance:
///
///     CachedAsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/icon.png")) { phase in
///         if let image = phase.image {
///             image // Displays the loaded image.
///         } else if phase.error != nil {
///             Color.red // Indicates an error.
///         } else {
///             Color.blue // Acts as a placeholder.
///         }
///     }
///
/// To add transitions when you change the URL, apply an identifier to the
/// ``CachedAsyncImage``.
